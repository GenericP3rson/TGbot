0,experienced,1816,https://community.tigergraph.com/t/data-loading-issue/633,I have experienced this in earlier versions where data was actually loaded but the counts on graphstudio are wrong. Graphstudio and non-distributed queries use an estimation method to get a count of vertices on remote nodes; this method had issues in earlier versions. The true count was only available when we ran count query in a distributed mode - which collects actual counts from every node and presents the true count to the user.<br>There was another issue with overflow in the internal kafka where data was pushed but lost before it was written to disk. But 300K should not be a problem. Just to debug you may start with 100K and check if you get consistent result. Putting my 2 cents here hope it helps
